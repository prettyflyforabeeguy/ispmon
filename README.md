Monitor your ISPs speed using Ookla's speedtest.net tool from a Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS
It's set to check every 15 minutes but can be changed by chancing the wait time in main()

You'll need to download the cli and add speedtest.exe and add it to this folder.
https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli

You may need to run the executable once to accept their license agreement.
